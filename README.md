This script automates various static analysis tasks, including calculating both SHA-256 and MD5 hashes, scanning them with VirusTotal, extracting strings with FLOSS, identifying any malicious API calls, and printing any URLs found which are then scanned with VirusTotal.
usage: python3 automated.py or ./automated.ps1 
I used https://malapi.io/ to identify malicious APIs. Make sure to download the malapi.txt file.
